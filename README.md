Modeling time-varying functional connectivity of human brains with fMRI data naturally calls for Dynamic Bayesian Networks(DBNs). In this paper, we model brain connectivity with DBNs, and demonstrate results with the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, specifically, the Carnegie Mellon University dataset. We perform PCMCI algorithm for structure learning using both parametric and non-parametric independence test criteria and, based on the learned model structures, we conduct two inference tasks: ASD(Autism Spectrum Disorder) prediction and activation prediction. The paper also conducts a scalability study of various conditional independence test methods and reports their corresponding running time.  We demonstrate that the proposed method can be a useful tool in determining brain abnormalities for ASD.
